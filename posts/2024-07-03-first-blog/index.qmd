My first semester as a graduate student has finally ended{{< fa face-grin-stars >}} This semester, I took a Spatial Data Mining class and wrote a term paper using GWR(Geographically Weighted Regression) and GRF(Geographic Random Forests). I want to share what I did with this blog post.

My goal was to see if there is spatial non-stationarity in the regional total fertility rate in South Korea. I set the Sigungu level as the study scale. Sigungu is the second-largest administrative region in South Korea.

## What is spatial non-stationarity?

Spatial non-stationarity means that the relationship between variables is spatially varying.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
#| warning: false

library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(writexl)
library(GGally)
library(car)
library(sf)
library(spdep)
library(tmap)
library(spgwr)
library(SpatialML)
library(randomForest)
library(ranger)
library(GWmodel)
library(cowplot)
library(biscale)

options(scipen = 999)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center

sgg <- st_read("bnd_sigungu_00_2020_2020_4Q.shp", quiet = TRUE)
qtm(sgg)
```

A dependent variable is the **Total fertility rate**. I used the following variables as independent variables:

-   **Population density**(*pop_den*)

-   **Average birth incentive per capita**(*incentive*)

-   **The proportion of women with college degrees or higher**(*grad*)

-   **The age of first marriage for women**(*first*)

-   **The number of childcare facilities per 1,000 children under 6**(*under6*)

-   **Gross regional domestic product per capita**(*grdpPercap*)

all the variables are based on data from the year 2020.

## Global analysis

### Correlation analysis

Before analyzing the variables locally, I conducted some global analysis.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
library(readxl)
TFR <- read_excel("TFR2020.xlsx")
str(TFR)
summary(TFR)
```

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
library(GGally)
TFR |> 
  select(tfr, pop_den, incentive, grad, first, under6, grdpPercap) |> 
  ggpairs()
```

I found that some variables have skewed distributions, so I decided to apply log transformation to those variables.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
TFR_log <- TFR |> 
  mutate(
    tfr_log = log(tfr),
    popden_log = log(pop_den),
    incentive_log = log(incentive + 1),
    grad_log = log(grad),
    grdpPercap_log = log(grdpPercap)
  ) |> 
  select(-c(tfr, grad, grdpPercap, pop_den, incentive))

TFR_log |> 
  select(-c(sgg, name)) |> 
  relocate(tfr_log, popden_log, incentive_log, grad_log, first, under6, grdpPercap_log) |> 
  ggpairs()
```

Now the distributions look much better than before. In this correlation matrix, I found that there are some significant correlations between independent variables. This is called multicollinearity, and in the regression analysis, it negatively affect the results. Researchers usually address this issue by removing some variables or conducting dimension reduction techniques such as Principle Component Analysis (PCA). However, in my case, **"global correlations"** between independent variables do not necessarily imply **"local correlations"**. Therefore, I decided to use all the variables as they are.

### Regression Analysis

I also conducted an Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLS) to examine the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

```{r}
TFR_log_sgg <- TFR_log[-1, ] # first row contains the value of the whole country.
model_log <- lm(tfr_log ~ 
                  popden_log + incentive_log + grad_log + first + under6 + grdpPercap_log,
                data = TFR_log_sgg)
summary(model_log)
```

Three variables (*popden_log, first, under6*) showed the most significance, followed by *incentive_log* and *grad_log*. *grdpPercap_log* showed no significance. The coefficient of determination ($R^2$) was 0.6221, and the adjusted $R^2$ was 0.6128. I considered this model sufficient to explain the relationship.

Using the result of the regression analysis, I evaluated the model's performance with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

```{r}
obs_val <- TFR_log_sgg$tfr_log
pred_val_OLS <- model_log$fitted.values
res_OLS <- obs_val - pred_val_OLS

rmse_OLS <- sqrt(mean(res_OLS^2))
rmse_OLS
mae_OLS <- mean(abs(res_OLS))
mae_OLS
```

### Spatial visualization

Before moving on to the local analysis, I wanted to see the distribution of the variables. So, I created choropleth maps for all the variables. To make a map, I joined table data containing the variables with the spatial data.

```{r}
library(sf)

sgg <- st_read("bnd_sigungu_00_2020_2020_4Q.shp", quiet = TRUE)
summary(sgg)
sgg$SIGUNGU_CD <- as.integer(sgg$SIGUNGU_CD) # convert "SIGUNGU_CD" in "sgg" as integer
sgg_TFR <- sgg |> # join table data with spatial data
  left_join(TFR_log, join_by(SIGUNGU_CD == sgg)) |> 
  select(-c(pop, pop_den))
summary(sgg_TFR)
```

I used "sido" data for better visualization. 

```{r}
#| fig-align: center

library(tmap)
sido.shp <- st_read("SIDO_2021_gen.shp", quiet = TRUE) # sido is the largest administrative region in South Korea
tm_shape(sgg_TFR) +
  tm_polygons("tfr_log", style = "jenks", palette = "-PuOr", border.col = "gray20", lwd = 1,
              title = "Total Fertility Rate(2020)",
              midpoint = 0
              )+
  tm_shape(sido.shp) +
  tm_borders(col = "black", lwd = 2)
```

I also made maps for the independent variables using a self-made function.

```{r}
var_mapping <- function(value, title) {
  tm_shape(sgg_TFR) +
    tm_polygons(value, style = "jenks", palette = "BuPu", border.col = "gray20", lwd = 1,
                title = title) +
    tm_shape(sido.shp) +
    tm_borders(col = "black", lwd =2)
}
```

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 10

map1 <- var_mapping("popden_log", "Population Density(2020)")
map2 <- var_mapping("incentive_log", "Birth Incentive(2020)")
map3 <- var_mapping("grad_log", "Proportion of Women with College Degree of Higher(2020)")
map4 <- var_mapping("first", "Age of First Marriage for Women(2020)")
map5 <- var_mapping("under6", "Number of Childcare Facilities per 1,000 under 6(2020)")
map6 <- var_mapping("grdpPercap_log", "GRDP per Capita(2020)")

tmap_arrange(map1, map2, map3, map4, map5, map6, ncol = 2, nrow = 3)
```

GWR and GRF will be introduced in the following posts.
